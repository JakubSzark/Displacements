# Source-Like-Displacements
WIP Scripts for making source-like displacements in unity

All you need is the stuff in the scripts folder.
Use by right clicking in heirarchy and going to 3D Object > Displacement
Then you can adjust the component and click generate.

E - Move
R - Sculpt
T - Smooth


I need help with these scripts and need to add more like a custom shader with 
texture painting. If you have suggestions or would like to help pls email me at
jakubshark@gmail.com. or on reddit @jakubshark
